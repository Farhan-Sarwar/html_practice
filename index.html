		<h3><p>Cricket is a game of passion, dedication, and teamwork. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza is my favourite cricketer. His commitment toward this great game can't be described by words. This gentleman of the game has faced several wounds in his body while serving the game as well as his nation. But he always ensured a glorious comeback by surpassing all adversities. To date, he is the most successful captain of Bangladesh. His attitude of never giving up is a key reason behind his magnificent success.</p></h3>
